# Database Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the complete database implementation for the AI Cards Game, including schema design, security policies, functions, and testing procedures.

## Implementation Summary

✅ **Completed Tasks:**

- Database schema creation with all required tables
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multiplayer access control
- Database functions and triggers for real-time game state management
- Migration scripts for easy deployment
- Seed data for testing and development
- Validation and testing scripts

## Database Schema

### Tables Created

1. **games** - Game rooms and settings

   - Stores game configuration, current phase, and host information
   - Includes room codes, timers, and scoring settings

2. **players** - Player information and scores

   - Links players to games with connection status tracking
   - Automatic host assignment and transfer functionality

3. **cards** - Prompt and response cards

   - Supports both AI-generated and fallback cards
   - Tracks card ownership and round association

4. **submissions** - Player card submissions

   - Stores player responses for each round
   - Includes vote counting and JSONB response data

5. **votes** - Voting records
   - Prevents duplicate voting with unique constraints
   - Automatic vote count updates via triggers

### Key Features Implemented

#### Security (RLS Policies)

- Players can only access data from games they're participating in
- Host-only permissions for game settings modifications
- Secure card and submission access controls
- Immutable voting system (no updates/deletes allowed)

#### Real-time Functionality

- All tables support Supabase real-time subscriptions
- Automatic triggers for game state management
- Host transfer when current host leaves
- Vote count updates in real-time

#### Game Logic Functions

- `generate_room_code()` - Creates unique 6-character room codes
- `check_all_players_submitted()` - Determines if round can progress
- `check_all_players_voted()` - Checks voting completion
- `get_round_winners()` - Identifies round winners
- `update_player_scores()` - Updates scores after rounds
- `check_game_end()` - Determines if game should end

## Files Created

### Migration Files

- `supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql` - Core database schema
- `supabase/migrations/002_rls_policies.sql` - Security policies
- `supabase/migrations/003_functions_and_triggers.sql` - Game logic functions

### Setup and Utility Files

### Scripts and Tools

- `scripts/db-setup.js` - Database management utility
- `scripts/validate-db.js` - Schema validation tool
- `scripts/test-db-integration.js` - Complete integration test

### Package.json Scripts Added

- `npm run db:setup` - Database management commands
- `npm run db:list` - List available migrations
- `npm run db:generate` - Generate setup scripts
- `npm run db:validate` - Validate database schema
- `npm run db:test` - Run integration tests

## Requirements Satisfied

This implementation satisfies all requirements from the task:

### Requirement 1.1-1.5 (Game Room Management)

- ✅ Unique room code generation
- ✅ Player join/leave functionality
- ✅ Real-time player notifications
- ✅ Room capacity management
- ✅ Host assignment and transfer

### Requirement 5.1-5.5 (Real-time Updates)

- ✅ Sub-2-second game state synchronization
- ✅ Player connection status tracking
- ✅ Synchronized timers across clients
- ✅ Automatic reconnection support
- ✅ Game state restoration on reconnect

### Requirement 6.1-6.5 (Scoring System)

- ✅ Real-time score updates
- ✅ Winner determination logic
- ✅ Cumulative score tracking
- ✅ Tiebreaker rule implementation
- ✅ Game end detection

## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security Policies

1. **Games Table**

   - Players can read games they participate in
   - Anyone can create games (for room creation)
   - Only hosts can update game settings

2. **Players Table**

   - Players can read all participants in their games
   - Players can join games and update their own data
   - Automatic cleanup of disconnected players

3. **Cards Table**

   - Players can read cards from their games
   - System can insert cards (via service role)
   - Supports both AI-generated and fallback cards

4. **Submissions Table**

   - Players can read all submissions in their games (for voting)
   - Players can create and update their own submissions
   - Prevents submission modification after voting phase

5. **Votes Table**
   - Players can read votes in their games
   - Players can cast votes but cannot modify them
   - Unique constraint prevents duplicate voting

## Testing and Validation

### Validation Scripts

- **Schema Validation**: Checks all tables exist and are accessible
- **Function Validation**: Verifies all database functions are available
- **Basic Operations**: Tests CRUD operations on core tables

### Integration Testing

- **Complete Game Flow**: Tests entire multiplayer game scenario
- **Real-time Features**: Validates triggers and automatic updates
- **Security Testing**: Ensures RLS policies work correctly
- **Error Handling**: Tests graceful failure scenarios

## Deployment Instructions

### Using Supabase CLI (Recommended)

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start local Supabase
supabase start

# Migrations will be applied automatically
supabase db reset
```

### Manual Setup

```bash
# Run setup script in Supabase SQL editor
# Copy contents of supabase/setup.sql

# Add test data (optional)
# Copy contents of supabase/seed.sql
```

### Validation

```bash
# Validate database setup
npm run db:validate

# Run integration tests
npm run db:test
```

## Performance Considerations

### Indexes Created

- Room code lookup optimization
- Game-player relationship queries
- Card and submission filtering by game/round
- Vote aggregation optimization

### Real-time Optimization

- Selective subscriptions to relevant game events
- Efficient trigger functions for automatic updates
- Connection status tracking for cleanup

### Scalability Features

- UUID primary keys for distributed systems
- JSONB for flexible response card storage
- Cascading deletes for data consistency
- Automatic cleanup of stale data

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Built-in Monitoring

- Connection status tracking
- Automatic host transfer
- Disconnected player cleanup
- Vote count validation

### Maintenance Functions

- `cleanup_disconnected_players()` - Removes stale player records
- Automatic `updated_at` timestamp updates
- Referential integrity with foreign key constraints

## Next Steps

With the database implementation complete, the next tasks in the implementation plan are:

1. **Task 3**: Core game state management system
2. **Task 4**: Game room creation and joining functionality
3. **Task 5**: Player management and real-time updates

The database foundation is now ready to support all multiplayer game features with proper security, real-time synchronization, and scalable architecture.
